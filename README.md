# Thesis-test-scripts

This repository contains the scripts needed to run 
the testing the dynamic window implementation 
of RMLStreamer against Flink's native window implementation. 

## 1) Kafka services 

 This script will setup the kafka brokers in docker 
 containers for generating 
 the input data to be processed by RMLStreamer. 



```bash 
./setup-kafka-script.sh 
```
The following kafka topics will be generated: 
* ndwflow -- input data about traffic flow  
* ndwspeed -- input data about traffic speed 
* metrics -- metrics collected for the window join operation 
* output -- triples generated by RMLStreamer


## 3)  Stop scripts 
The script will run the relevant docker commands 
to stop the kafka brokers and flink servers.  
```bash
./stop-eval-script.sh
```



## Reading from the Kafka broker 

To read a particular topic from the kafka broker just run the 
following script: 

```bash 
./read-from-topic.sh  [topic] #by default reads from "metrics" 
```
